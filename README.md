## 💾 Sample Output

```bash

[17:30:35] 192.168.0.101 -> 172.105.252.87 | TCP
    Payload: b'POST /login.php HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 172.105.'
```

And logs are saved in `logs.txt` like:

```bash
192.168.0.101 -> 172.105.252.87 | Protocol: TCP
```

## 📁 Sample `.pcap`

A sample `.pcap` file is saved after capture ends (on Ctrl+C).
File will be named like `capture_20250701_1745.pcap`.

> 🧪 You can open it in Wireshark.
